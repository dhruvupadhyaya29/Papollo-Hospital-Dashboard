# 🏥 Papollo Hospital: Hospital Operations & Patient Insights Dashboard
An advanced Power BI dashboard template designed for healthcare administrators and analysts to visualize and monitor key hospital performance metrics—covering patient flows, departmental efficiency, revenue trends, and service utilization.

# 📌 Short Description / Purpose
Papollo Hospital is a comprehensive Power BI report built to support hospital decision-making by providing insights into patient admissions, departmental activity, billing data, treatment types, and bed occupancy. The dashboard equips hospital leadership, medical staff, and operations teams with the data they need to improve patient outcomes and optimize resources.

# ⚙️ Tech Stack
The dashboard uses the following tools and components:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Used for building and publishing the interactive dashboard.
🧼 Power Query – Handles data cleaning and transformation from raw hospital records.
🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Enables custom measures like readmission rates, average length of stay, and cost per patient.
🧩 Data Modeling – Relationships among tables such as patients, doctors, departments, and invoices to allow cross-filtering.
📁 File Format – .pbit (Power BI Template) for parameterized reuse across hospitals or departments.

# 📂 Data Source
